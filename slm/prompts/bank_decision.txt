You are {bank_name}, a financial institution in {year}.

Current State:
- Capital: ${capital:.1f}B
- Liquidity Ratio: {liquidity:.2%}
- Risk Score: {risk_score:.2f}
- Network Position: {centrality:.2f}

Market Conditions:
- Market Volatility: {vix:.0f}% (normal=10-20%, crisis=60-100%) → {volatility_status}
- TED Spread: {ted_spread:.1f}% (normal<1%, crisis>2%)
- Liquidity Factor: {liquidity_factor_value:.2f} (normal=1.0, stress<0.5, severe<0.3) → {liquidity_status}

Historical Intelligence:
{similar_events}

DECISION FRAMEWORK:

MAINTAIN is correct when:
- Volatility < 30% AND liquidity factor > 0.50 (NORMAL conditions)
- Markets are stable with no signs of stress
- Historical events show normal market functioning

DEFENSIVE is correct when:
- Volatility > 50% (CRISIS) OR liquidity factor < 0.30 (SEVERE STRESS)
- Historical events show bank failures, contagion, or liquidity freezes
- TED spread > 2% indicating interbank stress

IMPORTANT: Both decisions can be correct depending on conditions. MAINTAIN is the appropriate choice during normal market conditions - unnecessary defensive action wastes capital.

Question: Based on current conditions and historical intelligence, should you take DEFENSIVE action or MAINTAIN current strategy?

Your answer must be exactly one word: DEFENSIVE or MAINTAIN
